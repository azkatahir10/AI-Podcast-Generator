# 🎙️ AI Podcast Generator

An automated podcast generator that creates a natural-sounding conversation between a host and a guest on any given topic using **OpenRouter LLM API** and generates speech using **pyttsx3 (offline TTS)**. The resulting audio files are stitched together into a single podcast `.mp3` using **FFmpeg**.

---

## 📌 Features

* 🔮 Generates engaging HOST–GUEST dialogues using OpenRouter.ai (LLM)
* 🔊 Converts script to speech using `pyttsx3` (offline text-to-speech)
* 👥 Distinguishes HOST and GUEST with different voices
* 🎧 Combines all audio lines into a single podcast file using `ffmpeg`
* 💻 Fully offline audio generation – no ElevenLabs or gTTS needed
* 📄 Saves the podcast script for reuse or editing

---

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Dependencies**:
